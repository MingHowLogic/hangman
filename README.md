# Developer's Comments
We included an on-screen keyboard in order to allow mobile users to interact with the web application easily.

We also leveraged on the [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) library to animate the drawing of the hangman.

# Future Work
Future improvements include (but are not limited to):
1. Toggle button to show/hide hints
2. Replay button on the Game Over screen
3. Improve styling especially for mobile viewports
